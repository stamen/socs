socs
====

Socs, pronounced as /soʊˈʃəz/, short for Socials in the book [The Outsiders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outsiders_\(novel\)), helps create social sharing widgets.

This tool has no external dependencies and theoretically should work in all browsers from IE8+ onward.

See `socs.js` and [examples](examples) for documentation on how to use.
